# Historical winnowing and spatial averaging: implications for prehistoric archaeology
### Emily Coco & Radu Iovita

Code and spatial data provided in this repository used to assess the effects of systematic loss of data through time on estimates of regions of similarity. 

spatial-averaging.R, spat-average-small-props.R, and time-based-averaging.R are written to run in HPC environments and produce CSVs with data to produce distance decay curves. 

aged-minimums-analysis.R and minimum-analysis.R are scripts for producing figures and regression tables.

radiocarbon-europe.R performs the fitting of the curve to radiometric dates from Europe.
